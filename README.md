## A Decentralized Drone Delivery Management System (DDDMS) for Machine IDs

## Overview

The Decentralized Drone Delivery Management System (DDDMS) is a cutting-edge, blockchain-enabled platform designed to revolutionize the logistics industry. This peer-to-peer system allows users to autonomously enlist their drones for various delivery tasks, creating an efficient and decentralized delivery network. Leveraging GPS, IoT, and blockchain technologies, DDDMS aims to provide secure, transparent, and reliable delivery services.

## Key Features

- **User Registration and Drone Listing:** Users can register and list their drones, specifying details like specifications, availability, and service fees.
- **Delivery Request and Matching:** Customers can place delivery requests; the system matches these with the best-suited drone.
- **Real-Time Tracking:** GPS technology integration allows for real-time tracking of drones and deliveries.
- **Blockchain Integration:** Secure and transparent transactions with blockchain technology using the Polkadot and Peaq SDK's for payment processing and drone identity verification.
- **Feedback and Rating System:** Post-delivery feedback mechanism for service improvement.
- **Analytics Dashboard:** Data-driven insights for drone operators and administrators.
- **Docker Containerization:** The application is containerized using Docker for scalable and easy deployment.

## Technologies Used

- **Frontend:** Next.js 14, Tailwind CSS, Framer Motion
- **Backend:** Express.js, Supabase Auth, Database and Real-time features
- **Blockchain:** Peaq network js sdk.
- **Others:** Redis (caching), Docker (containerization), Lightweight Charts (analytics), GPS and IoT integration (pending)
